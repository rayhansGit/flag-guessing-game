I have designed a flag guessing game using the tkinter ui library. The game is simple and fun to play
First step is providing the number of rounds you want to play. After that, the flag images will start poping and
you have to guess the name of that country.
After finishing the round, the result window will pop up and show you the total right guesses you made. You are allowed
to write the country name in caps or lower case.
The system is designed in such a way that it will show random flags everytime you run this
